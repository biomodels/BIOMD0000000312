Abstract:  
The physiological responses of cells to external and internal stimuli are
governed by genes and proteins interacting in complex networks whose dynamical
properties are impossible to understand by intuitive reasoning alone. Recent
advances by theoretical biologists have demonstrated that molecular regulatory
networks can be accurately modeled in mathematical terms. These models shed
light on the design principles of biological control systems and make
predictions that have been verified experimentally.
